A website made to easily train one's knowledge of the readings and tones of any hanzi you wish with a KameSame-inspired interface. It does this by taking a list of hanzi you want to practice, then sampling a dictionary of either HSK words or dictionary words to show you that you will give the pinyin for. It then checks each character against your entry and update your skill level with that character according to whether you got its reading correct or not. If you got it wrong, words with that character will appear more often, and vice versa.
